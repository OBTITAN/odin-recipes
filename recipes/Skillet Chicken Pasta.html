    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Skillet Chicken Pasta is a hearty, one-pan dish that brings together tender, 
       seasoned chicken, al dente pasta, and a rich, flavorful sauce for a satisfying meal 
       that's perfect for busy weeknights. This recipe combines succulent chicken breasts or 
       thighs with a medley of garlic, onions, and tomatoes, simmered in a creamy or tomato-based 
       sauce infused with herbs and spices. The pasta absorbs all the delicious flavors as it 
       cooks in the same skillet, making for an easy, mess-free preparation. 
       Whether you prefer a classic Parmesan cream sauce or a zesty marinara twist, 
       this dish is endlessly customizable with vegetables, cheeses, or a touch of spice. 
       Serve it hot, garnished with fresh basil and grated cheese, for a comforting, 
       restaurant-quality meal at home</p>
